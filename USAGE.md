# CPS Challenge Visualizer — Usage

A plug-and-play harness + raylib visualizer for the Bosch RTAS 2026
Physics-Driven Real-Time CPS Challenge. It drives the `LateralMotionControl` FMU
for N vehicles sharing `N_cores` cloud cores under a scheduling policy you choose,
records the run, and shows the cars lapping the track — the reference path, the
actual driven path, the lateral error, and where a car breaches its bounds.

The FMU itself is documented in [`readme.md`](readme.md); the task/network/metric
parameters are in [`examples/`](examples).

## Build

Requires CMake ≥ 3.16 and a C++17 compiler. raylib is fetched and built
automatically the first time you configure (needs network once).

```sh
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j
```

The executable is `build/cps`.

## Run

```sh
# Live visualization (opens a window). Defaults: RateMonotonic, 1 vehicle, v=10.
./build/cps

# Multiple vehicles sharing 3 cloud cores, context-aware scheduler:
./build/cps --vehicles 6 --scheduler context

# Headless (no window): run fast and print per-vehicle metrics.
./build/cps --headless --vehicles 6 --scheduler rm --duration 120

# Save a run, then replay/scrub it later without re-simulating:
./build/cps --headless --vehicles 4 --save run.cpsr
./build/cps --replay run.cpsr
```

Key options: `--scheduler rm|edf|context|honest|ttu|partitionedRM|partitionedEDF|partitionedContext|partitionedHonest|partitionedTTU`,
`--vehicles N`,
`--cores N`, `--profile 10|12.5|15`, `--duration SEC`,
`--exec avg|worst|best|pert`, `--overrun kill|skip`, `--net-delay MS` (fix
both network delays, for delay-tolerance sweeps), `--delta-max RAD` +
`--triage` + `--validate-predictor` (prediction system, see PREDICTOR.md),
`--seed N`, `--schedule-viz FILE.svg` (write a standalone scheduler timeline),
`--schedule-viz-ms MS` (default 120), `--headless`, `--csv FILE` (append per-vehicle summary rows for
sweeps), `--save FILE`, `--replay FILE`, `--screenshot FILE` with
`--screenshot-at N`, `--select N`, `--speed X` (aim scripted screenshots).
Run `./build/cps --help` for the full list.

Fixed-priority policies use the strict total order (period, vehicle, kind) —
deterministic across platforms and exactly the model BOUND.md §7 analyzes.
`ttu` is the predictive scheduler (ranks on time-to-point-of-no-return from
held-command plant rollouts); the visualizer shows the selected car's
predicted path as a dotted line with 0.8 m-crossing and point-of-no-return
markers, live and in replays (recording format v4).

Scheduler notes: `context` scores on ground-truth metrics (an **oracle** upper
bound); `honest` is the same scoring restricted to the estimator-derived remote
metrics the cloud legitimately sees. Prefix a policy with `partitioned` to run
one independent policy instance per fixed core partition (`vehicle % nCores`,
no migration): with 3 vehicles / 3 cores, vehicle 0 -> core 0, vehicle 1 ->
core 1, vehicle 2 -> core 2; with 6 vehicles / 3 cores, vehicles 0 and 3 ->
core 0, 1 and 4 -> core 1, 2 and 5 -> core 2. `prm` and `partitioned` remain
aliases for `partitionedRM`. `--overrun kill` (default) is kill-and-hold: an
unfinished job is dropped at its next release and the output register holds;
`skip` lets the overrunning job finish while skipping passed releases. The
metrics table prints two worst-case data ages per vehicle: `age_fresh`
(freshest-contributing convention) and `age_path` (oldest-direct / classical
chain path — the one BOUND.md targets); see DATA_AGE.md §4d.

`--schedule-viz FILE.svg` records only the first `--schedule-viz-ms` milliseconds
of scheduling decisions and writes an SVG with one row per core. Each core row is
split into four task lanes: `E` estimator, `C` controller, `F` feedforward, and
`M` merger. Bar color identifies the vehicle; the lane identifies the task. For
global policies, jobs are placed on SVG core rows by the order returned from the
policy. For partitioned policies, SVG rows are the fixed partition core ids.

### Visualizer controls

| Key | Action | Key | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Space` | play / pause | `[` `]` | select previous / next vehicle |
| `←` `→` | scrub / step (replay) | `F` | follow selected car / overview |
| `↑` `↓` | playback speed | `wheel` | zoom |
| `,` `.` | error exaggeration | `H` | toggle help |

The track shows the **gray centerline** (expected path), **yellow ±0.2 m** soft
(comfort) bounds and **red ±0.8 m** hard (safety) bounds. The driven path is
offset from the centerline by the lateral error, exaggerated (default ×25) so
it's visible, and colored green→red by error magnitude. Hard breaches are marked
red on the track and on the timeline so you can jump straight to them.

## Add your own scheduling method

The common case is a new **core-arbitration policy**: given the cloud jobs that
want to run this tick (across all vehicles) and the shared core count, decide
which get a core. You may use each vehicle's live control metrics (`VehicleView`)
for context-aware decisions.

1. Create `src/sched/policies/MyPolicy.cpp` (auto-picked up by CMake):

   ```cpp
   #include <algorithm>
   #include "sched/policies/Policies.h"

   namespace cps {
   namespace {
   class MyPolicy : public CorePolicy {
   public:
     void assign(const std::vector<ReadyJob>& ready, int nCores,
                 const std::vector<VehicleView>& ctx,
                 std::vector<int>& chosen) override {
       // ... pick up to nCores indices into `ready` ...
     }
     const char* name() const override { return "MyPolicy"; }
   };
   }  // namespace
   std::unique_ptr<CorePolicy> makeMyPolicy() {
     return std::unique_ptr<CorePolicy>(new MyPolicy());
   }
   }  // namespace cps
   ```

2. Declare `makeMyPolicy()` in [`src/sched/policies/Policies.h`](src/sched/policies/Policies.h)
   and add a case to `makePolicy()` in [`main.cpp`](main.cpp). Rebuild — done.

See [`RateMonotonic.cpp`](src/sched/policies/RateMonotonic.cpp) and
[`ContextAware.cpp`](src/sched/policies/ContextAware.cpp) for worked examples.

For full control over the 16 FMU triggers (e.g. data-driven, aperiodic triggering
— Challenge Q6), subclass `Scheduler` directly (see
[`src/sched/Scheduler.h`](src/sched/Scheduler.h)) and pass it to the `Simulation`
instead of a `PolicyScheduler`.

## Layout

```
src/fmu/    FMI 2.0 wrapper (loads the dylib once, N instances) + value refs
src/trace/  loads a profile's reference track + per-tick FMU inputs (CSVs)
src/sched/  Scheduler interface, declarative task model, CorePolicy, policies/
src/sim/    co-simulation master loop + run recording
src/viz/    raylib visualizer
main.cpp    pick scheduler / vehicles / profile / mode
```
